# AIG-Project
AIG Shields Up Cybersecurity

## Objective

Mastercard Cybersecurity virtual experience program on Forage - September 2024

 * Completed a job simulation where I served as an analyst on Mastercard’s
   Security Awareness Team 
 * Helped identify and report security threats such as phishing 
 * Analyzed and identified which areas of the business needed more robust
   security training and implemented training courses and procedures for those
   teams

## Task 1 Responding to a zero-day vulnerability:

How to address a vulnerability that may affect Product Development Staging Environment infrastructure: 
* Review some recent publications from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
* Research the reported vulnerability
* Draft an email to affected teams to alert them of the vulnerability, and explain how to remediate


### Practice :
Here are the instructions for this task
The CISA has recently published the following two advisories:

The first advisory (Log4j), outlines a serious vulnerability in one of the world’s most popular logging software.
The second advisory explores how ransomware has been increasing and is becoming professionalized - a concern for a large company like AIG.
Your task is to respond to the Apache Log4j zero-day vulnerability that was released to the public by advising affected teams of the vulnerability. 

First, conduct your research on the vulnerability using the “CISA Advisory" resources provided above as a starting point.

Next, analyze the “Infrastructure List” below to find out which infrastructure may be affected by the vulnerability, and which team has ownership.

## Task 2 (Technical) Bypassing ransomware:

What ‘bruteforcing’ involves and how to respond to a ransomware virus using Python:
* Write a Python script to bruteforce the decryption key of the encrypted file, to avoid paying a ransom

How to design and implement the appropriate training for those teams to lower our risk of an attack:
* Create a short presentation to help teams improve security awareness 
Now that you've analyzed the results, it's time to create a short presentation (3-5 slides) providing some awareness and training materials for the two teams that appear to be most susceptible. This will help us improve the security awareness of the teams that performed poorly in this campaign.

## Skills:

Communication, data analysis, data presentation, design thinking, problem solving, security awareness training, technical security awareness. 

## Take away:

I recently participated in Mastercard's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Security Awareness team at Mastercard.
I worked on a project to identify phishing emails and design security awareness training courses. Through this job simulation, I built my skills in problem-solving, data analysis, and data presentation and practiced them in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working in cybersecurity and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Security Awareness team at a company like Mastercard.
