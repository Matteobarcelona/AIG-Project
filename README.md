# AIG-Project
AIG Shields Up Cybersecurity

## Objective

AIG Shields Up: Cybersecurity virtual experience program on Forage - September 2024


 * Completed a cybersecurity threat analysis simulation for the Cyber Defense Unit, staying updated on CISA publications.
 * Researched and understood reported vulnerabilities, showcasing analytical skills in cybersecurity.
 * Drafted a clear and concise email to guide teams on vulnerability remediation.
 * Utilized Python skills to write a script for ethical hacking, avoiding ransom payments by bruteforcing decryption keys.

## Task 1 Responding to a zero-day vulnerability:

How to address a vulnerability that may affect Product Development Staging Environment infrastructure: 
* Review some recent publications from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
* Research the reported vulnerability
* Draft an email to affected teams to alert them of the vulnerability, and explain how to remediate


### Practice :
Here are the instructions for this task
The CISA has recently published the following two advisories:

The first advisory (Log4j), outlines a serious vulnerability in one of the world’s most popular logging software.
The second advisory explores how ransomware has been increasing and is becoming professionalized - a concern for a large company like AIG.
Your task is to respond to the Apache Log4j zero-day vulnerability that was released to the public by advising affected teams of the vulnerability. 

First, conduct your research on the vulnerability using the “CISA Advisory" resources provided above as a starting point.

Next, analyze the “Infrastructure List” below to find out which infrastructure may be affected by the vulnerability, and which team has ownership.

## Task 2 (Technical) Bypassing ransomware:

What ‘bruteforcing’ involves and how to respond to a ransomware virus using Python:
* Write a Python script to bruteforce the decryption key of the encrypted file, to avoid paying a ransom

## Skills:

Communication, data analysis, data presentation, design thinking, problem solving, security awareness training, technical security awareness. 

## Take away:

I recently participated in AIG's job simulation on the Forage platform, gaining valuable insights into what it's like to be part of a cybersecurity team at AIG. 
I worked on a project to create a cyber threat analysis simulation, delving into the possible vulnerabilities and how to fix them. I practiced using tools and languages relevant to cybersecurity such as Python, building my skills in a real-world context. 
This experience confirmed my passion for addressing cybersecurity challenges, and I'm enthusiastic about applying these skills on AIG's cybersecurity team to contribute to solving real-world problems.
